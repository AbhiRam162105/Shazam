Test script to verify the audio recording fixes for capturing full 5 seconds.

print("1. Backend (web_interface.py):")
print("   - Added 3-second overlapping buffer to prevent audio loss")
print("   - Improved final audio processing to handle 2+ second chunks")
print("   - Better logging for debugging audio capture")

print("   - Added 200ms delay after 5 seconds to capture final audio chunks")
print("   - Extended backend stop delay to 300ms to ensure all data is sent")

print("- Backend will process overlapping 5-second windows")
print("- Final audio processing will handle remaining chunks")
print("- Audio RMS levels should remain strong throughout")

print("\nðŸ“Š What to Look For in Logs:")
print("- 'Chunks collected: X' should continue increasing until ~5.2 seconds")
print("- '[FINAL] Processing final X.Xs of audio' for remaining chunks")
print("- No more 'No audio to process on stop' messages")
print("- Consistent audio levels (RMS ~0.15) throughout")

print("\nðŸš€ To Test:")
print("1. Start the web interface: python web_interface.py")
print("2. Open browser and record for 5 seconds")
print("3. Watch the console logs for the above indicators")
print("4. Audio should be captured fully without silent gaps")
